1. About Me

2. Intro to FP
   1. History of FP
   2. Review of Mathematical Functions
   3. Rules of FP
      1. Total
      2. Deterministic
      3. Pure
   1. Principles
      1. Immutability
      2. Referential Transparency
      3. Local Reasoning
      4. Higher Order Function (Function as First-Class Values)
      5. Recursion
      6. Type-Driven Design
      7. Declarative vs Imperative
3. Why FP is better - Easier to Read/Write
   1. Local Reasoning
   2. Referential Transparency
   3. Typically Shorter Code
   4. Parallelization is trivial
4. Why Scala
   1. Runs on the JVM
   2. Type System
   3. Declarative
5. Types
   1. TBD
6. Declarative
