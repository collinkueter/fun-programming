# History of Functional Programming

- (1930) Roots in academia, evolving from the lambda calculus (Alonzo Church in the 1930s), a formal system of
  computation based only on functions
- (1985) Miranda is a lazy, purely functional programming language designed by David Turner, but was proprietary
  software
- (1990) Haskell - A committee was formed to consolidate existing functional languages into a common one to serve as a
  basis for future research in functional-language design
- (1991) Paper called "Notions of computation and monads" by Eugenio Moggi
- (2001/2004) Scala
- (2022) Scala - one of the top paying languages (median income $96,979 Stack Overflow Developer Survey)

lambda calculus defined at the same time and context as turing machine

lambda calculus alternative formation of logic

How you interact with the outside world wasn't determined until 1991 in a paper called "Notions of computation and monads" by Eugenio Moggi

interacting with the outside world is critical to writing software - 1991 told us how we might do that
